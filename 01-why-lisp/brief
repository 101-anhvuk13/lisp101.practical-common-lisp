- get intentions faster (than other lang?) implemented with "ideal code"
- some anecdotal evidence (lispers got in stuck until knowing lisp)
- no instantly obvious payoff but lisp machine (low-level unit, cross-platform app, job,...)
- get a sense of lisp philosophy
- clearly mapping between idea and code
- more logic?, less code?, no limit?
- explore programming (write and incrementally know how it runs)
- easily adopt big new idea even no fundamental changes
- my friend's enticement
